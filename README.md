We will utilize the functionality of the webcam to analyze movements made by the player while the chess game is occurring. This AI is somewhat similar to the coaching AI program in chess.com; however, this AI specifically analyzes the chess game that is physically occurring and not digital. There can be options for which the user can chat directly with the AI, inquiring if the move made most recently was the right choice or if it was a “blunder.” Another option can be a full-scale analysis of the chess game when the game finishes. The AI would show the moves the user took and explain whether the moves were good or bad.
